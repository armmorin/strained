## üß≠ About This Project

### Real-World Problem

The development of energy technologies like solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is limited by the need for materials with high oxygen-ion conductivity at lower temperatures (400‚Äì600¬∞C). Materials like the hexagonal perovskite Ba‚ÇáNb‚ÇÑMoO‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ are promising candidates due to their unique layered structures, which contain intrinsic pathways for ion movement.

### Research Motivation

This research was driven by the need to systematically understand how **mechanical strain**, similar to what occurs when a thin film is grown on a substrate, affects the performance of these materials. By modeling how strain impacts ion migration, we can provide a roadmap for intentionally designing and fabricating materials with superior ionic conductivity.

### Significance of the Work

This study makes a key discovery: **compressive in-plane strain significantly *lowers* the energy barrier for oxygen-ion migration in Ba‚ÇáNb‚ÇÑMoO‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ by up to 15%**. This is a critical insight, as it provides a clear, actionable strategy for improving material performance. By carefully selecting substrates that induce compressive strain, it's possible to engineer more efficient solid electrolytes for future energy devices. The work provides atomic-scale insights into *why* this happens and shifts the material design paradigm from purely chemical adjustments to include mechanical and structural engineering.

## üîé Key Insights

- **Compressive strain boosts performance:** Applying compressive in-plane strain consistently lowers the oxygen-ion migration energy barrier by up to 0.14 eV, leading to a significant (~15%) enhancement in ionic conductivity. This is a counterintuitive finding compared to many other oxide materials.

- **Strain distorts the path for easier travel:** Strain induces specific structural distortions in the local atomic environment, creating more favorable pathways for oxygen ions to move through the crystal lattice.

- **A practical strategy for material design:** The results strongly suggest that epitaxial thin-film growth on substrates that induce compressive strain is an effective strategy for creating high-performance hexagonal perovskite conductors.

- **Mechanical tuning over chemical doping:** This work demonstrates that mechanically tuning a material's properties through strain can be a powerful alternative or supplement to traditional chemical doping.

## üìù Methodology

This project used a fully automated workflow to investigate the effects of strain on oxygen-ion migration in Ba‚ÇáNb‚ÇÑMoO‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ using first-principles calculations.

- **Dataset and Systems:**  
  
  Atomic-scale models of Ba‚ÇáNb‚ÇÑMoO‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ were built based on known crystal structures. All structural data and calculation results were managed in a **SQLite3 database** using the **Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)**. Various strain states (uniaxial and biaxial, up to ¬±3%) were systematically applied to simulate conditions relevant to experimental thin-film growth.

- **Workflow Management**  

  The entire computational pipeline‚Äîincluding structure relaxation, energy calculations, and migration barrier analysis‚Äîwas orchestrated using **PerQueue**, a dynamic workflow manager. This enabled the automated, high-throughput execution of thousands of jobs on high-performance computing (HPC) resources. All calculation parameters are defined in the `project_config.cfg` file for full reproducibility.

- **Calculation Process:**  

  -   Oxygen vacancy formation energies were computed to assess thermodynamic stability under strain.
  -   The **Nudged Elastic Band (NEB)** method was used to calculate the energy barriers for oxygen-ion migration along key diffusion pathways.

- **Analytical Tools:**  

**Continuous Symmetry Measure (CSM)** analysis was used to quantify distortions in the local coordination of migrating ions, directly linking structural changes to variations in the migration barrier.

## ü§î Interpretation

The findings from this project strongly suggest that **strain engineering is a vital and practical tool for designing superior solid oxide ion conductors**. The atomic-scale insights gained here provide a clear design principle: by controlling mechanical strain during synthesis, we can purposefully create materials with enhanced ionic conductivity. This shifts the focus of materials design from relying solely on chemical composition to embracing the powerful interplay between a material's structure, mechanics, and function. Ultimately, this approach can accelerate the development of more efficient and durable energy technologies, such as next-generation solid oxide fuel cells.
